# The simplest route is to pass MODEL_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS as a shell env when
# bringing compose up, but compose only honours env values that are wired in
# its environment: section. To avoid editing the compose file we use
# `docker exec` to spawn the eviction loop with the live module instead --
# importing the helper, monkeypatching the constants, and invoking the
# eviction sweep directly.
#
# This still exercises the real production code path: load_whisper_model,
# the eviction loop body, GPU memory clear, and the metrics counter.
